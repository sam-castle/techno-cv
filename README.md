Techno-cv is an interactive audio installation whereby a minimal techno track can be built-up and manipulated using just gestures. Displayed on a visual interface, samples can be selected and moulded, effects applied, and a sample synthesiser played, simply by moving one’s arms in space. The positions of your limbs are tracked using an opensource computer vision system, with the positions of your hands used to trigger buttons on the interface. These buttons in turn manipulate the parameters of a custom Max 8 patch in which samples are layered and filters applied to create a versatile minimal techno. A video of the installation can be found here.
